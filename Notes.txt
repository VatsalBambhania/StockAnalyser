Don't exceed the repeat request interval more than response time of request time of bsedata.BSE().getQuote()

In other words 
 interval to update graph > time to get data from getQuote()

For eg.
	if it takes getQuote 50ms to fetch data then interval to update graph should be greater than 50ms otherwise graph will get stuck.

Classes:
1) Basic Graph:
	Functions: 
	* Everytime new data comes
		Update graph
		call Analyser.update
	* Maintain array to store live data which is fetched

2) Analyser:
	Functions:
	On calling update function
		based on conditions it will recognizes and update based patterns (like Rod and Range for now, can add many different patterns in future)

3) Rod & Range:
	Functions:
	Retains the necessary values associated with pattern and display it on graph whenever conditions are right

Algorithm:

while True:
	
	if Rod is made:
		show rod on graph and update it's values

	else if Range is made:
		show range on graph and update it's values

	else if Rod and Range both are formed:
		sense breakout and wait for stability time
		if pattern retains it's form for desired time:
			show the whole pattern and continue sensing for more
		else:
			reset all based patterns (Rod and Range) and start all over again
